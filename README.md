# Data Science & Statistics Practicals

## Overview

This repository contains practical exercises and projects related to *data science* and *statistics*. It serves as a hands-on guide for various techniques, methodologies, and tools commonly used in these fields.

The aim is to help you understand key concepts in data analysis, machine learning, and statistical modeling through real-world examples and datasets.

## Contents

The repository is organized as follows:

- 01_data_cleaning/: Scripts and notebooks focused on data preprocessing and cleaning tasks (e.g., handling missing data, feature scaling).
  
- 02_exploratory_data_analysis/: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using statistical and visualization tools (e.g., histograms, scatter plots, correlation analysis).
  
- 03_statistical_tests/: Implementations of common statistical tests (e.g., t-tests, chi-square tests, ANOVA).
  
- 04_machine_learning/: Practical examples of machine learning algorithms (e.g., linear regression, classification, clustering).
  
- 05_model_evaluation/: Evaluation techniques for models, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC, AUC, and confusion matrices.
  
- 06_time_series_analysis/: Time series data processing and forecasting (e.g., ARIMA, seasonal decomposition).
  
- datasets/: Sample datasets used in the practicals. These can be replaced with your custom datasets.
  
- utils/: Utility scripts for common tasks such as data loading, preprocessing, and visualization.

## Installation

To run the notebooks and scripts in this repository, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/datascience-practicals.git
   cd datascience-practicals
   

2. Install the required dependencies:
   bash
